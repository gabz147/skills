## Codex Compatibility

This skill was ported from a Claude skill. Interpret Claude Code-specific wording using Codex equivalents:

- Use `functions.shell_command` for shell commands and filesystem inspection.
- Use `apply_patch` for manual file edits.
- Use `update_plan` for task checklists when a plan is useful.
- Use `web.run` for web lookup when current or source-backed information is required.
- Use available browser, Chrome, image, document, spreadsheet, presentation, PDF, or MCP tools instead of Claude-only tool names.
- Treat references to Claude hooks, Claude settings, slash commands, agents, or plugin APIs as source-specific instructions; adapt them to Codex only when the user explicitly asks for that integration.

<objective>
Generate a structured milestone summary for team onboarding and project review. Reads completed milestone artifacts (ROADMAP, REQUIREMENTS, CONTEXT, SUMMARY, VERIFICATION files) and produces a human-friendly overview of what was built, how, and why.

Purpose: Enable new team members to understand a completed project by reading one document and asking follow-up questions.
Output: MILESTONE_SUMMARY written to `.planning/reports/`, presented inline, optional interactive Q&A.
