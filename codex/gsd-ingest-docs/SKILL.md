description: "[Ported from Claude personal skill] Bootstrap or merge a .planning/ setup from existing ADRs, PRDs, SPECs, and docs in a repo."

## Codex Compatibility

This skill was ported from a Claude skill. Interpret Claude Code-specific wording using Codex equivalents:

- Use `functions.shell_command` for shell commands and filesystem inspection.
- Use `apply_patch` for manual file edits.
- Use `update_plan` for task checklists when a plan is useful.
- Use `web.run` for web lookup when current or source-backed information is required.
- Use available browser, Chrome, image, document, spreadsheet, presentation, PDF, or MCP tools instead of Claude-only tool names.
- Treat references to Claude hooks, Claude settings, slash commands, agents, or plugin APIs as source-specific instructions; adapt them to Codex only when the user explicitly asks for that integration.

<objective>
Build the full `.planning/` setup (or merge into an existing one) from multiple pre-existing planning documents - ADRs, PRDs, SPECs, DOCs - in one pass.

- **Net-new bootstrap** (`--mode new`, default when `.planning/` is absent): produces PROJECT.md + REQUIREMENTS.md + ROADMAP.md + STATE.md from synthesized doc content, delegating final generation to `gsd-roadmapper`.
- **Merge into existing** (`--mode merge`, default when `.planning/` is present): appends phases and requirements derived from the ingested docs; hard-blocks any contradiction with existing locked decisions.

Auto-synthesizes most conflicts using the precedence rule `ADR > SPEC > PRD > DOC` (overridable via manifest). Surfaces unresolved cases in `.planning/INGEST-CONFLICTS.md` with three buckets: auto-resolved, competing-variants, unresolved-blockers. The BLOCKER gate from the shared conflict engine prevents any destination file from being written when unresolved contradictions exist.

**Inputs:** directory-convention discovery (`docs/adr/`, `docs/prd/`, `docs/specs/`, `docs/rfc/`, root-level `{ADR,PRD,SPEC,RFC}-*.md`), or an explicit `--manifest <file>` YAML listing `{path, type, precedence?}` per doc.

**v1 constraints:** hard cap of 50 docs per invocation; `--resolve interactive` is reserved for a future release.
