## Codex Compatibility

This skill was ported from a Claude skill. Interpret Claude Code-specific wording using Codex equivalents:

- Use `functions.shell_command` for shell commands and filesystem inspection.
- Use `apply_patch` for manual file edits.
- Use `update_plan` for task checklists when a plan is useful.
- Use `web.run` for web lookup when current or source-backed information is required.
- Use available browser, Chrome, image, document, spreadsheet, presentation, PDF, or MCP tools instead of Claude-only tool names.
- Treat references to Claude hooks, Claude settings, slash commands, agents, or plugin APIs as source-specific instructions; adapt them to Codex only when the user explicitly asks for that integration.

<objective>
Interactive configuration of GSD workflow agents and model profile via multi-question prompt.

Routes to the settings workflow which handles:
- Config existence ensuring
- Current settings reading and parsing
- Interactive 5-question prompt (model, research, plan_check, verifier, branching)
- Config merging and writing
- Confirmation display with quick command references
</objective>

<execution_context>
@$HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/settings.md
</execution_context>

<process>
**Follow the settings workflow** from `@$HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/settings.md`.

The workflow handles all logic including:
1. Config file creation with defaults if missing
2. Current config reading
3. Interactive settings presentation with pre-selection
4. Answer parsing and config merging
5. File writing
6. Confirmation display
</process>
