description: "[Ported from Claude personal skill] Manage GSD workspaces - create, list, or remove isolated workspace environments"

## Codex Compatibility

This skill was ported from a Claude skill. Interpret Claude Code-specific wording using Codex equivalents:

- Use `functions.shell_command` for shell commands and filesystem inspection.
- Use `apply_patch` for manual file edits.
- Use `update_plan` for task checklists when a plan is useful.
- Use `web.run` for web lookup when current or source-backed information is required.
- Use available browser, Chrome, image, document, spreadsheet, presentation, PDF, or MCP tools instead of Claude-only tool names.
- Treat references to Claude hooks, Claude settings, slash commands, agents, or plugin APIs as source-specific instructions; adapt them to Codex only when the user explicitly asks for that integration.

<objective>
Manage GSD workspaces with a single consolidated command.

Mode routing:
- **--new**: Create an isolated workspace with repo copies and independent .planning/  to  new-workspace workflow
- **--list**: List active GSD workspaces and their status  to  list-workspaces workflow
- **--remove**: Remove a GSD workspace and clean up worktrees  to  remove-workspace workflow
</objective>

<routing>

| Flag | Action | Workflow |
|------|--------|----------|
| --new | Create workspace with worktree/clone strategy | new-workspace |
| --list | Scan ~/gsd-workspaces/, show summary table | list-workspaces |
| --remove | Confirm and remove workspace directory | remove-workspace |

</routing>

<execution_context>
@$HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/new-workspace.md
@$HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/list-workspaces.md
@$HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/remove-workspace.md
@$HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/references/ui-brand.md
</execution_context>

<context>
Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

Parse the first token of $ARGUMENTS:
- If it is `--new`: strip the flag, pass remainder (--name, --repos, --path, --strategy, --branch, --auto flags) to new-workspace workflow
- If it is `--list`: execute list-workspaces workflow (no argument needed)
- If it is `--remove`: strip the flag, pass remainder (workspace-name) to remove-workspace workflow
- Otherwise (no flag): show usage - one of --new, --list, or --remove is required
</context>

<process>
1. Parse the leading flag from $ARGUMENTS.
2. Load and execute the appropriate workflow end-to-end based on the routing table above.
3. Preserve all workflow gates from the target workflow (validation, approvals, commits, routing).
</process>
