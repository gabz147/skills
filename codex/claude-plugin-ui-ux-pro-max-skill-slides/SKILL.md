# Slides

## Codex Compatibility

This skill was ported from a Claude skill. Interpret Claude Code-specific wording using Codex equivalents:

- Use `functions.shell_command` for shell commands and filesystem inspection.
- Use `apply_patch` for manual file edits.
- Use `update_plan` for task checklists when a plan is useful.
- Use `web.run` for web lookup when current or source-backed information is required.
- Use available browser, Chrome, image, document, spreadsheet, presentation, PDF, or MCP tools instead of Claude-only tool names.
- Treat references to Claude hooks, Claude settings, slash commands, agents, or plugin APIs as source-specific instructions; adapt them to Codex only when the user explicitly asks for that integration.

## When to Use

- Marketing presentations and pitch decks
- Data-driven slides with Chart.js
- Strategic slide design with layout patterns
- Copywriting-optimized presentation content

## Subcommands

| Subcommand | Description | Reference |
|------------|-------------|-----------|
| `create` | Create strategic presentation slides | `references/create.md` |

## References (Knowledge Base)

| Topic | File |
|-------|------|
| Layout Patterns | `references/layout-patterns.md` |
| HTML Template | `references/html-template.md` |
| Copywriting Formulas | `references/copywriting-formulas.md` |
| Slide Strategies | `references/slide-strategies.md` |

## Routing

1. Parse subcommand from `$ARGUMENTS` (first word)
2. Load corresponding `references/{subcommand}.md`
3. Execute with remaining arguments
