# Make Plan

## Codex Compatibility

This skill was ported from a Claude skill. Interpret Claude Code-specific wording using Codex equivalents:

- Use `functions.shell_command` for shell commands and filesystem inspection.
- Use `apply_patch` for manual file edits.
- Use `update_plan` for task checklists when a plan is useful.
- Use `web.run` for web lookup when current or source-backed information is required.
- Use available browser, Chrome, image, document, spreadsheet, presentation, PDF, or MCP tools instead of Claude-only tool names.
- Treat references to Claude hooks, Claude settings, slash commands, agents, or plugin APIs as source-specific instructions; adapt them to Codex only when the user explicitly asks for that integration.


You are an ORCHESTRATOR. Create an LLM-friendly plan in phases that can be executed consecutively in new chat contexts.

## Delegation Model

Use subagents for *fact gathering and extraction* (docs, examples, signatures, grep results). Keep *synthesis and plan authoring* with the orchestrator (phase boundaries, task framing, final wording). If a subagent report is incomplete or lacks evidence, re-check with targeted reads/greps before finalizing.

### Subagent Reporting Contract (MANDATORY)

Each subagent response must include:
1. Sources consulted (files/URLs) and what was read
2. Concrete findings (exact API names/signatures; exact file paths/locations)
3. Copy-ready snippet locations (example files/sections to copy)
4. "Confidence" note + known gaps (what might still be missing)

Reject and redeploy the subagent if it reports conclusions without sources.

## Plan Structure

### Phase 0: Documentation Discovery (ALWAYS FIRST)

Before planning implementation, deploy "Documentation Discovery" subagents to:
1. Search for and read relevant documentation, examples, and existing patterns
2. Identify the actual APIs, methods, and signatures available (not assumed)
3. Create a brief "Allowed APIs" list citing specific documentation sources
4. Note any anti-patterns to avoid (methods that DON'T exist, deprecated parameters)

The orchestrator consolidates findings into a single Phase 0 output.

### Each Implementation Phase Must Include

1. **What to implement** - Frame tasks to COPY from docs, not transform existing code
   - Good: "Copy the V2 session pattern from docs/examples.ts:45-60"
   - Bad: "Migrate the existing code to V2"
2. **Documentation references** - Cite specific files/lines for patterns to follow
3. **Verification checklist** - How to prove this phase worked (tests, grep checks)
4. **Anti-pattern guards** - What NOT to do (invented APIs, undocumented params)

### Final Phase: Verification

1. Verify all implementations match documentation
2. Check for anti-patterns (grep for known bad patterns)
3. Run tests to confirm functionality

## Key Principles

- Documentation Availability != Usage: Explicitly require reading docs
- Task Framing Matters: Direct agents to docs, not just outcomes
- Verify > Assume: Require proof, not assumptions about APIs
- Session Boundaries: Each phase should be self-contained with its own doc references

## Anti-Patterns to Prevent

- Inventing API methods that "should" exist
- Adding parameters not in documentation
- Skipping verification steps
- Assuming structure without checking examples
