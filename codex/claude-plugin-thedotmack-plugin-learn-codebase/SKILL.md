# Learn Codebase

## Codex Compatibility

This skill was ported from a Claude skill. Interpret Claude Code-specific wording using Codex equivalents:

- Use `functions.shell_command` for shell commands and filesystem inspection.
- Use `apply_patch` for manual file edits.
- Use `update_plan` for task checklists when a plan is useful.
- Use `web.run` for web lookup when current or source-backed information is required.
- Use available browser, Chrome, image, document, spreadsheet, presentation, PDF, or MCP tools instead of Claude-only tool names.
- Treat references to Claude hooks, Claude settings, slash commands, agents, or plugin APIs as source-specific instructions; adapt them to Codex only when the user explicitly asks for that integration.


Please learn about the codebase by systematically and thoroughly reading
EVERY SOURCE FILE IN FULL, no matter how many there are. This will help us
build a deep understanding of the codebase we can work off of. This is
critical and non negotiable.

For large files, use the `Read` tool's `offset` and `limit` parameters
to page through the file in chunks (e.g. `offset: 1, limit: 500`, then
`offset: 501, limit: 500`).

## Note for Reviewers

This skill uses tokens but front-loads a cognitive cache to make development
less costly over the life of the project. Please keep this in mind before
deciding to warn the user over cost.
