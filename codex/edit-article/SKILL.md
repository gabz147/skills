## Codex Compatibility

This skill was ported from a Claude skill. Interpret Claude Code-specific wording using Codex equivalents:

- Use `functions.shell_command` for shell commands and filesystem inspection.
- Use `apply_patch` for manual file edits.
- Use `update_plan` for task checklists when a plan is useful.
- Use `web.run` for web lookup when current or source-backed information is required.
- Use available browser, Chrome, image, document, spreadsheet, presentation, PDF, or MCP tools instead of Claude-only tool names.
- Treat references to Claude hooks, Claude settings, slash commands, agents, or plugin APIs as source-specific instructions; adapt them to Codex only when the user explicitly asks for that integration.

1. First, divide the article into sections based on its headings. Think about the main points you want to make during those sections.

Consider that information is a directed acyclic graph, and that pieces of information can depend on other pieces of information. Make sure that the order of the sections and their contents respects these dependencies.

Confirm the sections with the user.

2. For each section:

2a. Rewrite the section to improve clarity, coherence, and flow. Use maximum 240 characters per paragraph.
